Markdown Extra Set
==================

- [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
- [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)

This takes the original [Markdown Set][1] and extends it to include some of the
Markdown Extra syntax such as tables and definitions.

The parser is the actual PHP Markdown Extra parser, so you can use the full Markdown
Extra syntax. I would like to provide a javascript parser such as [markdown-extra-js][2]
but it has some bugs that would make it unstable.
